## Bank Marketing

**Problem**

There exists a bank that implements a telemarketing campaign to its customers. The bank's goal is to predict who will successfully subscribe to a term deposit.   

This problem is essentially a binary classification question that will investigate the factors that lead to a successful subscription.


**Data**

The entire data set contains over 41,000 records with 21 attributes. Examining these attributes can help us predict which customer will subscribe to the term deposit.

More about the data set can be found here, [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) at UC Irvine's archive for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.
